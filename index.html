    I am going to give you my Creole gumbo recipe.<br> I learned to cook from my mother and grandmother who were born and raised in New Orleans and really knew how to cook. <br>Most of the time, you could not get them to write down their recipes because they used a 'pinch' of this and 'just enough of that' and 'two fingers of water,' and so on.<br>This recipe is a combination of both of their recipes which I have added to over the years. <br> over hot cooked rice. The gumbo can be frozen or refrigerated and many people like it better the next day. Bon appetit!

        Could classic chicken and rice be one of the most beloved comfort dinners to ever hit the plate? We think so. And to blow your mind even more, this version is made in just one skillet. Here we use bone-in, skin on chicken thighs which cook up in exactly the same time as the rice to guarantee juicy chicken. A quick broil at the end creates the perfect crispy skin and gives a little crunch to the rice and vegetables.
