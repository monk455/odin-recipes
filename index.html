    <p>   
    I am going to give you my Creole gumbo recipe.<br> I learned to cook from my mother and grandmother who were born and raised in New Orleans and really knew how to cook. <br>Most of the time, you could not get them to write down their recipes because they used a 'pinch' of this and 'just enough of that' and 'two fingers of water,' and so on.<br>This recipe is a combination of both of their recipes which I have added to over the years. <br> over hot cooked rice. The gumbo can be frozen or refrigerated and many people like it better the next day. Bon appetit!
