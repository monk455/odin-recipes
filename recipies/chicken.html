        <h1>The Best Chicken and Rice</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons canola oil
            </li>
            <li>4 to 6 bone-in, skin on chicken thighs (about 6 ounces each)  </li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 medium carrots (about 12 ounces), sliced into 1/4-inch rounds </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Preheat the broiler. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toss the chicken with the paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Place the chicken skin-side down in the skillet and cook undisturbed until the skin is golden but not too dark, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate using a metal spatula and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. </p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Add the carrots, celery and shallots to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not yet turning golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, thyme, oregano, lemon zest, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook just until you begin to smell the garlic, about 1 minute. Stir in the rice and cook undisturbed until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Pour in the broth, add 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir to combine, then add the chicken thighs back to the pan, skin-side up. Bring the liquid to a boil then cover, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.   </p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Remove the lid from the pan and broil until the chicken skin is crispy and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the chives.   </p>
            
        </ol>
